Build it from Scratch

Starter projects can be difficult for beginners to use because of all the moving pieces. To help you understand this starter project, there is a [7-step walkthrough](http://andrewhfarmer.com/build-your-own-starter/) showing how to create it from scratch.




More Details
---

* No CSS. For experiments or tests, put your styles in `index.html` in a `<style>` tag. For real projects, pick from [these style tools](http://andrewhfarmer.com/how-to-style-react/).
* No Flux. If you need it - try [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) or [MobX](https://github.com/mobxjs/mobx)!
* Webpack is run with the `express` and `webpack-dev-middleware`.
* The 'content base' is set to `www`. Any files in that directory will be served by express.
